## Dependent Services
There are numerous APIs implemented throughout the MPS architecture, and the relevant endpoints are illustrated below. For an overview of all PODS APIs, refer to the [PODS API Documentation](https://confluence.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/display/PODSP/PODS+API+Latest+Version).

## Note on terminology
The terms scheme reference number and submission reference number (SRN) are interchangeable within the PODS codebase; some downstream APIs use scheme reference number, some use submission reference number, probably because of oversight on part of the technical teams who developed these APIs. This detail means the same thing, the reference number that was returned from ETMP when the scheme details were submitted.
